## Description:
This notebook demonstrates my understanding of two advanced machine learning techniques â€” Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€” as part of Week 2 of my GenAI & Data Science Internship at Flexisaf Edusoft Limited.

The Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning method, was implemented to show how multiple decision trees can be combined to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, a kernel-based algorithm, was trained to find optimal hyperplanes for classification, demonstrating its strength in handling non-linear data.

Both models were trained and evaluated on a structured dataset to compare performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. This work illustrates my ability to apply and analyze advanced supervised learning techniques for practical data-driven problem-solving.
